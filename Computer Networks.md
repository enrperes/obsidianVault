- PAN (Personal Area Network)
- LAN (Local)
- MAN (Metropolitan)
- WAN (Wide)
- Internet

###### LAN: 
Communication system between autonomous computers within a limited area (building). Must be reliable with low error rate.

#### Topology

###### Bus topology 
The transmission medium is shared by all devices. 
CSMA/CD Protocol to avoid collisions. (Carrier Sense with Multiple Access with Collision Detection). 
- Ring topology 
- Star topology 
- Tree topology

ARPA (cold war)
Advanced Research Projects Agencyi

plan to create a communication Network which would not be vulnerable to nuclear attacs. 

1969 ArpaNET - connecting computers across the country

Using **Packet Switching approach**: messages broken up into packets, routet across the network. The final point must then reassemble the message. 

1974 -> became TCP (Transmission control protocol)

IP (internet protocol) to ensure packets were delivered to the right destination. 
1982 combined TCP and IP adopted as commmunication standard for different networks. 
Internet became wildly used to describe the concept of a WWN. 
High speed backbone for supercomputers. 

Internet mostly used for University research and defend contractors. Early 1990s also private companies. 
TCP/IP became standard  in 1982 between different networks

E-mails -> mid 1960s

##### Computer vs Mainframes 
Big, powerful, reliable computer. Non scalable. 


### OSI Model 
Open System Interconnection.
Standard definined by ISO (Internetional Standard Organization)
Aimed at proposing a reference standard for different network designs. So computers belonging to different networks could communicate.
