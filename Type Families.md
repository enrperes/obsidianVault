Refers to a group of **related** classes or interfaces that share common properties. 
These classes often inherit from a common base class (or interface) -> **hierarchy**

- Code reuse
- Abstraction

#### GOAL:

> Way or representing families of related data types 

We define a **type hierarchy**: 
1. General type
2. Subtypes
	- That refine it.
