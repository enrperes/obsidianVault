If the network takes active role in **allocating resources**: 
- Congestion may be avoided
- No need for congestion control
But: allocating resources with precision beforehand is impossible.
Other option: let the sources send as much data as they want, then recover from the congestion when it occurs (**congestion avoidance**)
Another option is to let the source send as much data as they want but stop them before congestion occurs $\Large \longrightarrow$ **congestion avoidance**.
