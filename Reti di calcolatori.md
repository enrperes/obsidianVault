## Connectivity 
- Link
- Nodes 
- Two main types of connections: 
	- Point-to-point (more limited or expensive)
	- Multiple Access (not so scalable)
- Switched Network 
	- Where specialized nodes allow to connect differente network trunks
		- Circuit Switched 
		- Packet Switched
- Packet, Message
- Store and Forward

## Recursive definition of Network 

> A computer network is an entity formed by: 
> - 2 or more nodes connected by a medium 
> or
> - 2 or more networks connected by a node

> [!attention]  **** 
 > A Network is a hierarchy of networks (often different)
 
## Cost Effective Resource Sharing
How to share a link? 
- Multiplexing / Demultiplexing 
- Synchronous Time division
	- Time slots, data transmitted in predetermined time slots
- FDM: Frequency Division Multiplexing
	- Range of frequencies assigned to each channel 
- Statisstical multiplexing 
	- Data transmitted based on demand of each flow

## Reliability
Networks should hide the errors. 
- lost bits
- packet loss
- Link / node fail
- Messages are delayed
- Messages delivered out of order

# Network Architecture
A *layered architecture* is adopted.

### Repeater 

### Bridge

### Router 

### Proxy
