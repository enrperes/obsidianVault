Thematically, it centres on the consequences of [totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism "Totalitarianism"), [mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance "Mass surveillance") and [repressive regimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing "Brainwashing") of people and behaviours within society.[[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four#cite_note-BenetReader-2)

One of the main points of the books is that a human being CAN be broken down completely. He'll believe whatever you tell him. The positive message is that it's really difficult to get inside someone's head and brainwash them.
