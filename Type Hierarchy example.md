```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return length * width;
    }
}
```

`Circle` and `Rectangle` are part of the same class (type family), `Shape`. They both inherit from the base class and they provide specific implementations of the `area()` method.
