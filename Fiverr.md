### ILLFATEDSHELL


	When viewing the crown rotate between both camera’s, it appears as if the Camera A and Camera B are just a repeat of the same scene instead of the camera change being a continuation of the scene in ongoing time. I would like towards the end of Camera B to have the crown tip pass right in front of the knockout of the letterform, just like the logo roughs show. (So I can use that as my cue to fade out from around that point.)  
  
	In Camera A, the sand looks off. It’s too reflective/pale to be dark sand. Looks a bit more like foam in a bubble bath.  
  
	The gold color is a smidgen too bright-yellow for me. I’m unsure if it’s the actual color of the model or how the lights are set up on it. I suspect the lights but I have no clue. 
  
	As for Camera B the camera is a bit too close to the subject and the dolly moving in is too fast. 
	Also, Camera B needs a tiny bit of a rotational movement to show off it’s dimensionality. I would like there to be no easing on the camera movement in on the dolly either, gives me more footage to edit from.  
  
And this next part I understand is a bit far out since I’m not very familiar with Blender so I thought I would just ask; how difficult would it to mirror Camera A’s movement to the other side of the model? It’s one of those, I’m happy with what I have... but is the grass is greener on the other side situations.  
  
(I included a rough edit of what I’ll eventually be making, please do not cut out any parts I did not include so I can further refine the edit with the new material.)

This is going to sound crazy and I feel like the client from hell but I have few more requests, and if you’ll at least entertain my ideas I’ll immediately re-hire you for another project (if you can tolerate my pickiness, of course). And if there is a tipping option on this platform, I will show you my gratitude in that way as well naturally. That is, as soon a I finalize the vector of the logo. Might be up to week-ish on that project at my current work load.  

I totally understand, you deserve to have the final product as you like! : ) 

  
I need your opinion on this request, do you think Camera B would more attractive if at 11 seconds, where the light catches the point of the crown and glows, if you made the lights so that happens at 14 seconds (where the original logo would be visually completed as the crown rotates around the letterform). Or would that be cheesy?  
  
Also, there’s a beautiful sheen on both Camera A and C (I absolutely love the sheen on the crown point in the foreground on Camera C, please extend that camera a few seconds, absolutely beautiful.) but Camera B looks a little... bland. Can you [add some sheen/light up the] silver model in an interesting way?  
  
Also can you make the inner crown less textured? Like it’s been worn smooth with usage. If it’s possible, and this sounds absolutely crazy to even ask this of you at this point and I assure I will tip you well or add additional fee on the next project, but is it possible to have a faint engraving of a topographical map (or some sort of simple wavy pattern) on the inside of the ring? Like a faint etching? Also is it possible to put two lines on the top and bottom of the inner ring as borders for the art?  
  
I don’t know if you noticed but that corner-shave fix you did (for the anti-aliased looking pic) was a call we made before motion was added to the project. Now seeing it in motion it’s hard to tell if the fix did anything or did it just kind of ‘mess’ with the edges needlessly. I have no clue. But in some cases your fix looks like a bevel, which might be an interesting idea for that silver model. Can we maybe look into that?  
  
When I said a frontal view I meant to say a head on shot of the model(s). No angles or rotation. With the crown point in it’s proper place as referenced in the rough logos I sent over.   
  
Just thought of this now but I’ll also give you a copy of my final project after I edit and color grade it as a sample for your fivver, if you think it’s a good enough piece for your portfolio of course.
