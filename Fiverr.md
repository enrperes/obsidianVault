### ILLFATEDSHELL

  
When viewing the crown rotate between both camera’s, it appears as if the Camera A and Camera B are just a repeat of the same scene instead of the camera change being a continuation of the scene in ongoing time. I would like towards the end of Camera B to have the crown tip pass right in front of the knockout of the letterform, just like the logo roughs show. (So I can use that as my cue to fade out from around that point.)  
  
In Camera A, the sand looks off. It’s too reflective/pale to be dark sand. Looks a bit more like foam in a bubble bath.  
  
	The gold color is a smidgen too bright-yellow for me. I’m unsure if it’s the actual color of the model or how the lights are set up on it. I suspect the lights but I have no clue. 
  
As for Camera B the camera is a bit too close to the subject and the dolly moving in is too fast. Also, Camera B needs a tiny bit of a rotational movement to show off it’s dimensionality. I would like there to be no easing on the camera movement in on the dolly either, gives me more footage to edit from.  
  
And this next part I understand is a bit far out since I’m not very familiar with Blender so I thought I would just ask; how difficult would it to mirror Camera A’s movement to the other side of the model? It’s one of those, I’m happy with what I have... but is the grass is greener on the other side situations.  
  
(I included a rough edit of what I’ll eventually be making, please do not cut out any parts I did not include so I can further refine the edit with the new material.)
