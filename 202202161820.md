In my head, what the overall project looks like varies from gray/silver stone/metal letterform with a gold crown slowly rotating in place around the letterform. Potentially, some red on the crown for the rendered scene (but not the overall logo which will be based on the model created, I’ll likely go one or two color(s) for the actual logo). That being lined out, I see a few different creative paths that may be fruitful and I’ve tried to include examples of said different paths. If none of that inspires you, do what you do best.

A brief explanation of the logo for symbolism purposes; the crown is intended to represent the act of suffering. That is symbolized with the representation of the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ as he was crucified, I figured that the most university understand representation of suffering. The body of the logo represents more generally the self and desires one has. Do with that what you will.

something like finely lit volumetric fog within your domain of expertise? Or can you render out a realistic sand if we went down a desert direction?
