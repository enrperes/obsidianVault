Life in the trenches during World War I was really hard and many soldiers decided to shoot themselves in order to be sent home or worst they decided to commit suicide.

Between the two trenches there was the so-called “No man’s land”. In the back there were the support and reserve trenches which could provide back-up in case of emergency and all were connected by a network of communications.

Life in the trenches was mostly tedious and time dragged, broken only by the horrors of an attack. In the morning the soldiers used to prepare for an enemy attack, they used to do the equipment check and other activities such as repairing and draining tranches, preparing latrines, or reinforcing trench walls.

Living conditions were cramped and filthy. Rats and mice were everywhere. The bottom of the trenches was filled with mud and water. Soldiers also had to fight against cold, they used newspapers as extra layers under their clothes to keep themselves warm.
