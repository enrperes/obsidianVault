#### Summary 
The novel Ulysses by James Joyce is set in ==Dublin==, and the events unfold over a single day, beginning at 8 o'clock (16th of June 1904)

The work has ==18 episodes== which correspond (in quite particular and approximate ways) to episodes in The Odyssey of Homer.
The main characters are ==Leopold Bloom==, a non-practising Jew, his wife Molly and Stephen Dedalus, a young intellectual to whom Bloom becomes a kind of father figure. Stephen is the focus of the first 3 episodes which trace his early - morning activities and the flow of his thoughts. In episode 4, the setting shifts to Bloom's home. The novel now follows Bloom's activities and thoughts as he attends a funeral, does business, has lunch, walks through the Dublin streets, suffers anxiety about his wife's infidelity, until Bloom and Stephen meet. Stephen is drunk and Leopold acts as his protector. The two begin to hallucinate (Leopold from fatigue, Stephen from the effects of alcohol) and their unconscious minds surface, revealing the depths and nuances of their personalities. Bloom takes Stephen home, gives him a meal and invites him to stay. Stephen opts to leave and Bloom goes to bed at 2 a.m. where his wife, Molly, lies awake, thinking about her life and experiences

### Most important features of Joyce's works

#### Stream of consciousness
Inner thoughts of a character -> noconnection between thoughts, no linking words, no capitalization, no punctuation, I mode. Breaks the tradition. 
#### Interior monologue
It's a narrative mode in which a character's thoughts are presented on the page with no interference from an interlocutor. It is free direct thought from a first person, interior point of view. It's a technique associated with Modernism.
