## Modernism
Modernism developed from the late 19th to the mid 20th century, after WWI. 
Modernism is considered to be a break from the past and a search for new forms of expression. 
Europe was in a period of industrialization and development, Modernism put an end to the Victorian morality. 

The main writers were: 
- Henry James
- Virginia Woolf 
- Joseph Conrad
- Thomas S. Eliot

One of the main themes of TS Eliot's long poem *The Waste Land* (1922) is the search for redemption and renewal in a sterile and empty landscape. 
Fragmentary images, obscure illusions, make this poem typical of Modernism, requiring the reader to have an active role ni interpreting the text. 

A sense of disillusionment and loss pervades American Modernist fiction. 

THe publication of the Irish writer James Joyce's Ulysses in 1922 was a landmark event in the development of Modernist literature. Portions of the book were considered obscene and Ulysses was banned for many years in English-speaking countries.
