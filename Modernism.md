## Modernism
Modernism developed from the ==late 19th to the mid 20th== century, after WWI mainly in Europe and North America.  
Modernism is considered to be a ==break from the past== and a search for new forms of expression. 
Europe was in a period of industrialization and development, Modernism put an end to the Victorian morality. 

Modernism precursors were Nietzcshe and Freud. 
The main writers were: 
- Henry James
- Virginia Woolf 
- Joseph Conrad
- T.S. Eliot (Thomas)
- [[James Joyce]]

In Italian literature the main writers were Montale, Ungaretti, Saba; breaking wiht the past: (Carducci, Pascoli, D'annunzio)


One of the main themes of TS Eliot's long poem *==The Waste Land==* (1922) is the search for redemption and renewal in a sterile and empty landscape. 
DIvided into 5 sections the poem explores the life in London in the aftermath of the WWI.

Fragmentary images, obscure illusions, make this poem typical of Modernism, requiring the reader to have an active role in interpreting the text. 

A sense of disillusionment and loss pervades American Modernist fiction. 

THe publication of the Irish writer James Joyce's Ulysses in 1922 was a landmark event in the development of Modernist literature. Portions of the book were considered obscene and Ulysses was banned for many years in English-speaking countries.
