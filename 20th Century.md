In 1903, the Wright brothers made what is considered the first flight in their aircraft named the Wright Flyer.
In the US, 1903 was also the year which saw the Ford Motor Company produce its first car, the Model A, which was closely followed by its first mass-produced car, the Model T, in 1908. It is estimated that there are now more than 1 billion motor vehicles in use in the world.

It was not until after World War I, when women proved themselves able to run homes, businesses, factories and agriculture in the absence of their menfolk, that a percentage of women in the UK were granted the right to vote through the Representation of the People Act.

After the Chartists' attempts to find strength in unity in the 1800s, the 1900s witnessed a consolidation of unions of workers, who began to finance the campaigns of Liberal

The period was marked by devastating wars in which nations were involved worldwide.
World War I (1914-1918) saw the deaths of almost one in three men aged between 18 and 25 years.
World War II killed more than 400K British people including 60K civilians.

In Dublin the Easter Rising turned rebels into heroes of a nation longing for self-rule and self-determination. The rebellion failed but initiated a series of events

Art Deco, a development of Art Nouveau, took its name from an exhibition held in Paris in 1925.
