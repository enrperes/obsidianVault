## Setting up a DaVinci Resolve Project Library on a LAN with PostgreSQL

  

This guide outlines the process of setting up a shared DaVinci Resolve project library on your local area network (LAN) using 

PostgreSQL. This allows multiple editors to collaborate on the same project, improving workflow and efficiency.  This is an 

intermediate to advanced setup, requiring some technical knowledge.

  

**Important Considerations Before You Start:**

  

* **PostgreSQL Expertise:**  While this guide attempts to be thorough, a basic understanding of PostgreSQL administration is 

beneficial.  You'll need to understand concepts like database creation, users, permissions, and potentially networking.

* **Networking:** You need a reliable LAN connection between all computers accessing the library.  Gigabit Ethernet is highly 

recommended.

* **Storage:** The PostgreSQL server needs fast, reliable storage.  SSDs are *highly* recommended for optimal performance.  Consider 

RAID for redundancy if data loss is unacceptable.

* **DaVinci Resolve Studio:** This feature *requires* DaVinci Resolve Studio, not the free version.

* **Licensing:** Ensure your DaVinci Resolve Studio license covers concurrent usage if multiple editors will be accessing the library 

simultaneously.

* **Firewall:**  Make sure your firewall allows communication between the DaVinci Resolve workstations and the PostgreSQL server on 

port 5432 (the default PostgreSQL port).

  

  

  

**Step 1: Prepare the PostgreSQL Server**

  

1. **Install PostgreSQL:**  Download and install PostgreSQL on a dedicated server machine (preferably Linux, but Windows or macOS will 

work).  Follow the official PostgreSQL installation instructions for your operating system: 

[https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

  

2. **Configure PostgreSQL:**  After installation, you need to configure PostgreSQL.  This typically involves:

    * **Setting a Password for the `postgres` User:**  This is the administrator account.

    * **Configuring Network Access:**  By default, PostgreSQL often only listens on `localhost`. You need to configure it to listen on 

the network interface that's connected to your LAN. This is done by editing the `postgresql.conf` file.  (Location varies depending on 

OS. Search online for "postgresql.conf location" for your OS.)  Find the line `listen_addresses = 'localhost'` and change it to 

`listen_addresses = '*'` (this listens on all available interfaces - proceed with caution, consider specifying your LAN IP range 

instead).  *Important:*  Consider the security implications of opening PostgreSQL to the network. Restrict access through firewall 

rules (see section 'Security Considerations').

    * **Configuring `pg_hba.conf`:** This file controls client authentication. You need to add entries that allow access from the 

DaVinci Resolve workstations. Add lines like this:

      ```

      host    resolve_db      all             192.168.1.0/24       md5  # Replace 192.168.1.0/24 with your LAN IP range.

      ```

      This allows connections from the specified IP range using MD5 password authentication. Adjust authentication method (e.g., trust 

for testing only - *not recommended for production*) based on your security requirements. *Restart PostgreSQL after making changes to 

`pg_hba.conf`.*

  

3. **Create a Dedicated Database:**  Log into the PostgreSQL server using `psql` (the PostgreSQL command-line interface) or a GUI tool 

like pgAdmin. Create a database specifically for DaVinci Resolve:

   ```sql

   CREATE DATABASE resolve_db;

   ```

4. **Create a Dedicated User:** Create a user specifically for DaVinci Resolve, with limited privileges. This enhances security.

   ```sql

   CREATE USER resolve_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_strong_password';

   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE resolve_db TO resolve_user;

   ```

   Replace 'your_strong_password' with a strong, unique password.

  

  

  

**Step 2:  Configure DaVinci Resolve Studio**

  

1. **Open DaVinci Resolve Studio.**

2. **Go to "Project Settings" (File > Project Settings).**

3. **Navigate to the "Collaboration" Tab.**

4. **Enable "Remote Project".**

5. **Database Configuration:**

   * **Database Type:** Select "PostgreSQL".

   * **Host:** Enter the IP address or hostname of your PostgreSQL server.

   * **Port:**  The default port is 5432.

   * **Database Name:** Enter the name of the database you created (e.g., `resolve_db`).

   * **Username:** Enter the username you created (e.g., `resolve_user`).

   * **Password:** Enter the password for the user.

6. **Click "Connect".**  DaVinci Resolve will attempt to connect to the PostgreSQL database.  If successful, you'll see a confirmation 

message. If it fails, double-check all the settings and ensure the PostgreSQL server is running and accessible from the DaVinci 

Resolve workstation.

7. **Create or Open a Project:** Now create a new project or open an existing one. DaVinci Resolve will store all project data (bins, 

timelines, effects, etc.) in the PostgreSQL database.

  

**Step 3:  Setting up Shared Media (Important!)**

  

The PostgreSQL database stores *project metadata* (the structure of your project), but it **does not** store the actual media files 

(video, audio, images).  You need to set up a shared storage location that all DaVinci Resolve workstations can access.  Options 

include:

  

* **NAS (Network Attached Storage):**  The most common and recommended solution.

* **Shared Folder on a Server:**  Ensure permissions are set correctly so all users have read/write access.

* **SAN (Storage Area Network):**  For high-performance workflows.

  

**Configure the "Media Storage" path in DaVinci Resolve Project Settings > Collaboration.** This should point to the shared storage 

location. *All media must be imported into this location.*

  

**Step 4:  Testing and Troubleshooting**

  

1. **Multiple Workstations:**  Open DaVinci Resolve Studio on multiple workstations.  Ensure they are all configured to connect to the 

same PostgreSQL server and media storage location.

2. **Import Media:** Import some media into the project on one workstation.

3. **Verify Access:**  On another workstation, verify that the imported media is visible.

4. **Timeline Editing:**  Create a simple timeline on one workstation and verify that it appears correctly on other workstations.

  

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

  

* **Connection Errors:** Double-check the PostgreSQL server IP address, port, database name, username, and password.  Verify network 

connectivity between the workstations and the server.

* **Media Not Found:** Ensure the media files are located in the shared storage location and that the "Media Storage" path is 

configured correctly in DaVinci Resolve Project Settings.

* **Database Errors:** Check the PostgreSQL server logs for any errors.

* **Performance Issues:**  Slow performance can be caused by network congestion, slow storage, or a heavily loaded PostgreSQL server.

  

  

  

**Security Considerations:**

  

* **Firewall:**  Configure your firewall to allow only necessary traffic to the PostgreSQL server on port 5432 from the DaVinci 

Resolve workstations.

* **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for the PostgreSQL user and the database.

* **User Permissions:** Grant the DaVinci Resolve user only the necessary privileges on the database.

* **Network Segmentation:** Consider isolating the PostgreSQL server on a separate network segment to reduce the risk of unauthorized 

access.

* **VPN:** If accessing the database over the internet (not recommended for production), use a VPN to encrypt the connection.
