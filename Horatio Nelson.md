## Horatio Nelson 
Vice-Admiral **Horatio Nelson**, **1<sup>st</sup> Duke of Bronte**, was a British flag officier in the Royal Navy. 
His inspirational leadership, great strategy and unconventional tactics brought a number of decisive British naval victories during the **French Revolution** and **Napoleonic wars**.
He is considered to be one of the greatest naval commanders in history. 

He was born in 1758 in a moderately prosperous Norfolk (rural region of England) family, and joined the navy through the influence of his uncle. He rose rapidly through the ranks and was leading naval commanders by the age of 20, in 1778. 
He fought in numerous other battles: he lost one arm in the *Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.*
In 1805, in the naval **Battle of Trafalgar** (which became one of Britain's greatest naval victories) Nelson was fatally wounded by a French sharpshooter. His body was brought back to England were his funeral took place. 

Nelson's death at Trafalgar secured his position as one of Britain's most heroic figures. 
Numerous monuments (Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London) have been created in his memory. 
He is also remembered for his famous quote: 

> *England expects that every man will do his duty*
