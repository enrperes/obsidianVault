## Colonial Conflict
England's involvement in Africa dated back to the 17th century when the Royal Africa
Company provided slaves for the English colonies in the Caribbean. The end of the legal
slave trade in 1807 did not stop British interest in the continent and the trade based
on palm-oil continued. But it was in the second half of the century that Britain mainly
extended her influence in Africa where international rivalry was very strong and Egypt,
Sudan, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rhodesia and Zambia became part of the Empire.
In 1899, after their defeat in what is referred to as the First Boer War, the British started
a new colonial conflict with the Boers, farmers of Dutch origin living in South Africa,
for the control of the diamond and gold mines of that region and because of the Boer
refusal to grant civil rights to British immigrants.
The (Second) Boer War was long and hugely expensive. It was criticised by people
at home because of the severe losses the British army suffered and dealt a deadly blow
to the imperialistic myth. It was also condemned by other European countries because
of Lord Kitchener's harsh policy. Boer resisters and their families were housed in
concentration camps where many died. When the war ended in 1902 the Boer Republics
of Transvaal and the Orange Free State were annexed to the British Empire.
