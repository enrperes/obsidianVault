### The picture of Dorian Gray
The story revolves around a portrait of Dorian Gray by Basil Hallward, an artist impressed and infatuated by Dorian's beauty. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat's [hedonistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism "Hedonism") worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life. Newly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a [libertine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertine "Libertine") life of varied [amoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorality "Amorality")experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the while, his portrait ages and records every one of Dorian's sins.
