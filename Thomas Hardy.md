# Thomas Hardy
1840-1925
Born in Dorset, region in England in 1840. He started writing novels with little succes.
The Wessex (rural countryside) novels continued with *The Return of the Native, The Mayor of Casterbridge, The Woodlanders, and Tess of the D'Urbevilles*, which shocked the Victorian public with its portrayal of a seduced woman and pessimistic outlook.  *Wessex tales* was published in 1888. 
Thomas Hardy then devoted himself exclusively to poetry, a genre which he preferred and published six volumes (*Wessex poems, Poems of the Past and Present and Satires of Circumstance*).
